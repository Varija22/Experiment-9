Program 1

AIM:

To demonstrate how to use pointers to access and iterate through elements of an array in C++.

Software Used:

Programiz

Theory:

Pointers are variables that store memory addresses. In C++, arrays and pointers are closely linked. The array name acts as a pointer to its first element. By using pointer arithmetic (e.g., `ptr++`), one can traverse array elements sequentially without using array indexing. This provides an efficient way to access and manipulate array elements.

Algorithm:

1. Start the program.
2. Declare an integer variable and an integer array.
3. Assign a pointer to the start of the array.
4. Print the first element of the array using the pointer.
5. Use a loop to iterate through the array using pointer arithmetic.
6. Print each element during iteration.
7. End the program.

Conclusion:

The program successfully demonstrates how pointers can be used to access and iterate over array elements using pointer arithmetic.

Program 2

AIM:

To demonstrate how to use pointers to store and access the address and value of a variable in C++.

Software Used:

Programiz

Theory:

A pointer is a variable that holds the memory address of another variable. Using the address-of operator (`&`), we can get the address of a variable. Using the dereference operator (`*`), we can access the value stored at that address. Pointers are fundamental in dynamic memory management and are widely used in advanced programming concepts.

Algorithm:

1. Start the program.
2. Declare an integer variable and assign a value.
3. Declare a pointer variable.
4. Store the address of the integer variable in the pointer.
5. Print the value of the integer, the address stored in the pointer, and the value accessed using dereferencing.
6. End the program.

Conclusion:

The program successfully demonstrates the use of pointers to access both the address and the value of a variable in C++.
